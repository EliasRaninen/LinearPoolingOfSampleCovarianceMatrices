# Linear Pooling Of Sample Covariance Matrices

This repository contains MATLAB code of the proposed covariance matrix estimator in the paper E. Raninen, D. E. Tyler and E. Ollila, "Linear pooling of sample covariance matrices," in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, doi: 10.1109/TSP.2021.3139207.

### MATLAB scripts
* `linpool.m` : script for computing the covariance matrix estimators. Supports real and complex-valued data.
* `example.m` : reproduces the mixed case from Table I of the paper.
