# Linear Pooling Of Sample Covariance Matrices

This repository contains MATLAB code of the proposed covariance matrix estimator in the paper E. Raninen, D. E. Tyler, and E. Ollila, "Linear pooling of sample covariance matrices", 2020, arXiv:2008.05854 [stat.ME]. A preprint is available from https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05854. We are currently revising the paper.

### MATLAB scripts
* `linpool.m` : script for computing the covariance matrix estimators. Supports real and complex-valued data.
* `example.m` : reproduces the mixed case from Table I of the paper.

<strong> Python </strong> code for the estimator can be found from https://github.com/EliasRaninen/CoupledRSCM/tree/main/Python.
